Scripting Portfolio

This is my scripts that I have made and used, created on a linux computer, during a scripting course at ECU.

It is broken into the weeks of the course.

If you want to run a script. Open a bash shell then type "./scriptname.sh"

Some scripts may need to load extra commands. Just look at the errors.
